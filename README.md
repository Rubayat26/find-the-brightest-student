# find-the-brightest-student

Create an array of student objects with around 5-6 students (hardcode it, no need to take user inputs), each student having the following attributes:
-        Name
-        Marks: Array
The objects should not contain any object methods, only name and marks. Your task is to find the brightest student of them all based on average marks. Consider the fact that multiple students might have the same average marks, in that case all of them would be considered brightest.
The outputs should be strictly like this:

Alice is the brightest student of them all
OR
Alice, John and Bob are the brightest students
